There are 8 registers. R0 is always reads 0, and writing to it has no effect.

Instructions:

ADD RD RX RY     | RD = RX + RY                        | 000
ADDI RD RX N     | RD = RX + N                         | 001
NAND RD RX RY    | RD = RX NAND RY                     | 010
LUI RD N         | STORE 10 bit N in top 10 bit of RD  | 011
SW RI RD N       | STORE RI TO RD+N                    | 100
LW RD RI N       | LOAD RD FROM RI+N                   | 101
BEQ RX RY N      | JUMP IP+1+N IF RX == RY             | 110
JALR RP RD       | STORE IP+1 IN RP AND IP=RD          | 111

All numbers are 16 bit
Every memory address is 16 bit, the first command is placed at address 0, if the first command is not a jump the second command will be placed at the physical address 2 and fetched at pc = 1.

Structure:

.DATA
<data section>
.TEXT
<code section>

Example:

.DATA                # Data section
VAR0: 0              # Store 0 (0x00 0x00), VAR0 is the address (0x0004 as the first six bytes are taken by JMP to START)
VAR1: 1              # Store 1 (0x00 0x01), VAR1 = 0x0005
5 8 11 128           # Store four more 16bit value in order
VIDEO: 45000         # This value is an address in video memory
.TEXT                # Code section
START:               # START label is mandatory, the first jump will be done here
ADD  R1 R0 R0        # Store 0 in R1
LUI  R2 VIDEO        # Store address of VIDEO (0x000A) in R2
ADDI R2 R2 VIDEO     # Store address of VIDEO (0x000A) in R2
LW   R3 R2 0         # Load the content of 0x000A (45000) to R3
SW   R1 R3 0         # Store the content of R1 (0) by address 45000, put it on screen
END:                 # just a label
LUI  R4 END          # Put the address of END to R4
ADDI R4 R4 END       # Put the address of END to R4
JALR R0 R4           # Jump to END, infinite loop
